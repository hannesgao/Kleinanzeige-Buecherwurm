## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. Quality Assurance Organization ✅
**Created:** `quality/` directory with three subdivisions:
- `audits/` - All security and code quality audit materials
- `reports/` - Quality assessment and summary reports  
- `testing/` - Project verification and testing tools

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of QA activities from development
- Professional organization following industry standards
- Easy access to quality metrics and audit trails

### 2. File Relocations ✅
**Moved files to appropriate locations:**
- `audit/*` → `quality/audits/`
- `POST_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` → `quality/reports/`
- `check_project.py` → `quality/testing/`

**Removed temporary files:**
- `test_env/` - Temporary virtual environment
- Empty directories after reorganization

### 3. Documentation Translation ✅
**Translated all Chinese content to English:**
- `POST_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete translation
- Updated all file path references in documentation
- Maintained technical accuracy while improving accessibility

### 4. English-Only Policy Implementation ✅
**Added to CLAUDE.md:**
```markdown
## Language Policy

**IMPORTANT**: All code comments, documentation, commit messages, and reports 
in this project must be written in English only. While the user may provide 
instructions in Chinese, all technical content should be in English to maintain 
consistency and accessibility for international developers.
```

### 5. Documentation Updates ✅
**Updated all documentation to reflect new structure:**
- `README.md` - Updated project structure and testing commands
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Complete restructure with quality/ section
- `quality/testing/check_project.py` - Added new path validations
